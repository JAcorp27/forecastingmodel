#forecastingmodel

When you are trying to predict future sales, you can use machine learning to predict it. However, Covid has changed how customers spend. 
Thus, you need to build an agile forecasting model that can predict future based on a current trend. 

If the trend is linear, you can apply y=a*x+b. However, the trend is showing an exponential trend. You cannot apply y=a*x+b. 
One way to do is log function to change y=a*x+b into time function.
