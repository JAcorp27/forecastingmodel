#forecastingmodel

When you are trying to predict future sales, you can use machine learning to predict it. However, Covid has changed how customers spend. 
Thus, you need to build an agile forecasting model that can predict future based on a current trend. It will be very hard to predict using historical data since the trend is not applicable to 2020 or 2021 trend. 

If the trend is linear, you can apply y=a*x+b. However, the trend is showing an exponential trend. You cannot apply y=a*x+b. 
One way to do is to apply log function to change y=a*x+b into time function. 

Sometimes, you can ideas from someone else's idea. I got an idea from analyzing covid-19 analysis.
